\section{Soft Robotics}

The field of soft robotics is relatively new and developmental. Soft robots inherently differ from traditional robots. They are constructed from compliant and pliable materials. Soft robots generally have fixed joints and locomotive actuators between joints, as opposed to traditional robots which usually have locomotive actuated joints connected by rigid sections \cite{Whitesides2018}.
