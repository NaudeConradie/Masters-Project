abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators form part of the growing field of soft robots being used in areas not suited to conventional hard-linked robots. Applications include low-cost automation, wearable technology, and the handling of easily damaged produce/goods. Typically these actuators are manufactured as cast silicone bodies and are powered by compressed air. This research set out to develop methods whereby these actuators can be designed to best represent a desired behaviour and behavioural responses not previously possible. A bimodal actuator was developed where the bending direction can be altered by changes to the internal pressure. This allows non-trivial behaviour whilst using a single pressure source. A layer of a specially developed bilinear material facilitates this response. This bilinear material utilises a strain limiter crimped to an initial condition. As the paper layer decrimps, the response becomes stiffer and approximates that of the reinforcing paper layer. This change in stiffness allows for the preferential bending direction of the actuator to change. An additional stream of research focused on a modular actuator construction made up of smaller articulating units in series. These units are constructed to have a preferential bending direction. By changing the orientation of each unit, a different deformed actuator shape can be made.

abstract = {Although the existing Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) have been traditionally used to model plant development graphically, it is also possible to interpret L-Systems for music rendering. However, many of the existing L-System modelling applications, especially for musical rendering do not cater a larger circle of people who may not be well-versed in music and neither for those with programming skill nor prior knowledge in L-Systems. In this paper, a visual programming framework is proposed for L-System music rendering in order to cater a larger circle of people including non-experts in L-System and music. A visual language framework for L-System has been developed and the usefulness and the efficiency of visual language in L-System music rendering have also been studied. The visual language framework includes the L-System attributes and standard musical grammar rules in the form of simplified icon-based visual language. Furthermore, the music rendering has also been further fine-tuned by using stochastic and context-sensitive L-Systems. Based on the evaluation of the proposed visual language framework, it has been shown to be effective in the sense that anyone who does not have prior knowledge in L-System music may also fully utilize the easily generated musical sound based on the original L-System concepts.},

abstract = {It is very difficult that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dementia (PDD) distinguish from PD patients, because PD patients may exhibit patterns of cognitive impairment. Recently, cardiac I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy has been used as tools to distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism. Thus, we performed this study to confirm significant clinical value of cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy for differential diagnosis between PD and PDD. Cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was studied in 18 patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and 13 normal controls that were matched for age, disease duration, and severity of symptoms. The heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio) was calculated. The mean value of H/M ratio of PDD and PD was significantly lower than normal controls. However, there were no differences between PDD and PD groups. Although cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy did not distinguish PDD from PD, we wish to focus attention on sustained studies that are needed to differentiate other Lewy body disease from many dementia patients with PD features. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This makes the algorithm highly effective when buckling and slenderness constraints with scatter in the data are introduced. A large set of numerical test examples is used to illustrate the capabilities of the method. The algorithm is shown to be effective and robust, making it suitable for the optimal design of very large truss structures.},

The artificial evolution of such creatures potentially offers some relief from the difficult and time consuming task of specifying morphologies and behaviors. But, while artificial life techniques have been used to create a variety of virtual creatures, previous work has not scaled beyond creatures with 50 components and the most recent work has generated creatures that are unnatural looking. Here we describe a system that uses Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) as the encoding of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for creating virtual creatures. Creatures evolved by this system have hundreds of parts, and the use of an L-system as the encoding results in creatures with a more natural look. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Reactive systems are often described by interconnecting sub-components along architectural connectors defining communication policies. Generally, such global systems may exhibit properties, often called "emergent properties", that cannot be anticipated just from a complete knowledge of components. These emergent properties are twofold: (1) the global system can question properties attached to components; (2) some global properties cannot be inferred only from a complete knowledge of components, but for being inferred, need the knowledge of cooperation mechanisms between components. In practice, properties of the second form combine knowledge inherited from components. Thus, they are often defined in a richer language than the ones associated to each component and the presence of such emergent properties is quite natural. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to reactive systems described by means of transition systems as components and of the usual synchronous product as architectural connector and whose behavior is expressed by logical properties over a modal first-order logic. In this framework, we propose to study complexity of reactive systems through this notion of emergent properties and we will give some conditions to guarantee when a system has not emergent properties of the first form.},

They can change their shape in a predefined way from shape A to shape B when exposed to an appropriate stimulus. While shape B is given by the initial processing step, shape A is determined by applying a process called programming. We review fundamental aspects of the molecular design of suitable polymer architectures, tailored programming and recovery processes, and the quantification of the shape-memory effect. Shape-memory research was initially founded on the thermally induced dual-shape effect. This concept has been extended to other stimuli by either indirect thermal actuation or direct actuation by addressing stimuli-sensitive groups on the molecular level. Finally, polymers are introduced that can be multifunctional. Besides their dual-shape capability, these active materials are biofunctional or biodegradable. Potential applications for such materials as active medical devices are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Unfortunately, the notions and terms are not especially well defined: ideas of evolution, self-organization, collective ('systemic') properties and cooperative behaviour are all involved to a greater or lesser extent. It is often claimed that emergent properties arise at a particular level of system description by virtue of the interaction of relatively simple lower-level components- between themselves and with the environment- but cannot be explained at this lower level. Yet there are obvious scientific and philosophical problems with a definition based on an inability to explain observable effects in particular terms.

abstract = {Soft robots have become increasingly popular in recent years - and justifiably so. Their compliant structures and (theoretically) infinite degrees of freedom allow them to undertake tasks which would be impossible for their rigid body counterparts, such as conforming to uneven surfaces, efficiently distributing stress, and passing through small apertures. Previous work in the automated deign of soft robots has shown examples of these squishy creatures performing traditional robotic task like locomoting over flat ground. However, designing soft robots for traditional robotic tasks fails to fully utilize their unique advantages. In this work, we present the first example of a soft robot evolutionarily designed for reaching or squeezing through a small aperture - a task naturally suited to its type of morphology. We optimize these creatures with the CPPN-NEAT evolutionary algorithm, introducing a novel implementation of the algorithm which includes multi-objective optimization while retaining its speciation feature for diversity maintenance. We show that more compliant and deformable soft robots perform more effectively at this task than their less flexible counterparts. This work serves mainly as a proof of concept, but we hope that it helps to open the door for the better matching of tasks with appropriate morphologies in robotic design in the future. {\&}copy; 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {The biological information coming from electrophysiologic sensors like ECG, pulse sensor or from molecular signal devices like NMR spectrometry has to be visualized and manipulated in a compressed way for an efficient medical use by clinicians, if stored in scientific data bases or in personalized patient records repositories. Here, we define a new transform called Dynalet based on Lie´nard ordinary differential equations susceptible to model the mechanism at the source of the studied signal, and we propose to apply this new technique first to the modelling and compression of real biological periodic signals like ECG and pulse rhythm. We consider that the cardiovascular activity results from the summation of cellular oscillators located in the cardiac sinus node and we show that, as a result, the van der Pol oscillator (a particular Lie´nard system) fits well the ECG signal and the pulse signal. The reconstruction of the original signal (pulse or ECG) using Dynalet transform is then compared with that of Fourier, counting the number of parameters to be set for obtaining an expected signal-to-noise ratio. Then, we apply the Dynalet transform to the modelling and compression of molecular spectra obtained by protein NMR spectroscopy. The reconstruc- tion of the original signal (peak) using Dynalet transform is again compared with that of Fourier. After reconstructing visually the peak, we propose to periodize the signal and give it to hear, the whole process being called the protein ??stethoscope".},

abstract = {We present the automated design and manufacture of static and locomotion objects in which functionality is obtained purely by the unconstrained 3-D distribution of materials. Recent advances in multimaterial fabrication techniques enable continuous shapes to be fabricated with unprecedented fidelity unhindered by spatial constraints and homogeneous materials. We address the challenges of exploitation of the freedom of this vast new design space using evolutionary algorithms. We first show a set of cantilever beams automatically designed to deflect in arbitrary static profiles using hard and soft materials. These beams were automatically fabricated, and their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6{\%} accuracy. We then demonstrate the automatic design of freeform soft robots for forward locomotion using soft volumetrically expanding actuator materials. One robot was fabricated automatically and assembled, and its performance was confirmed with 15{\%} error. We suggest that this approach to design automation opens the door to leveraging the full potential of the freeform multimaterial design space to generate novel mechanisms and deformable robots.},

abstract = {This paper describes a flexible Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator designed to increase the limited displacement that these alloys can induce. The SMA actuator has been designed so that it can be bent up to about 180°, providing more freedom of movements and a better integration in wearable robots, specially in soft wearable robots, than standard rigid solutions. Although the actuator length is relatively short, this original design allows a great linear displacement, because it can have one or more loops of the same SMA wire inside the actuator. This implies that the length of the SMA wire is at least two times greater than the length of the actuator. The adopted strategy for both position and speed control that overcomes the hysteresis and prevents overheating the actuator is also described. The control algorithm has been implemented in a rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on a low cost hardware platform. Finally, the application of this novel actuator in a wrist exoskeleton prototype is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of using the flexible SMA actuator in a real soft wearable robot.},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with di?erent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at di?erent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

Several methodologies have been proposed to model and analyse their quasi-static bending behaviour with negligible attention paid to their dynamic behaviour. We, therefore, report on an enhanced methodology to model their highly non-linear bending behaviour by treating them as smart and soft robotic manipulators. The methodology consists of an inverse kinematic model and a dynamic model. The proposed methodology accurately estimates the EAP actuator's whole shape deflection using optimization-based inverse kinematic solutions integrated with an electro-mechanical dynamic model. The experimental and numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the soft robotic manipulator model in estimating the highly non-linear bending behaviour of the polypyrrole electroactive polymer (PPy-EAP) actuators. The proposed methodology can easily be extended to other bending type actuators and active smart manipulators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of water vapor clouds in the stratosphere produces warming in excess of tropospheric greenhouse warming, via radiative warming in the lower stratosphere. The stratospheric clouds form only in regions of very low temperature and so the warming produced by the clouds is concentrated in polar winter regions. Results from a paleoclimate modeling study that includes idealized, prescribed polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) show that the clouds cause up to 20 degrees C of warming at high latitude surfaces of the winter hemisphere, with greatest impact in oceanic regions where sea ice is reduced. The modeled temperature response suggests that PSCs may have been a significant climate forcing factor for past time intervals associated with high concentrations of atmospheric methane. The clouds and associated warming may help to explain long-standing discrepancies between model-produced paleotemperatures and geologic proxy temperature interpretations at high latitudes, a persistent problem in studies of ancient greenhouse climates.},

However, many of the existing L-System modelling applications, especially for musical rendering do not cater a larger circle of people who may not be well-versed in music and neither for those with programming skill nor prior knowledge in L-Systems. In this paper, a visual programming framework is proposed for L-System music rendering in order to cater a larger circle of people including non-experts in L-System and music. A visual language framework for L-System has been developed and the usefulness and the efficiency of visual language in L-System music rendering have also been studied. The visual language framework includes the L-System attributes and standard musical grammar rules in the form of simplified icon-based visual language. Furthermore, the music rendering has also been further fine-tuned by using stochastic and context-sensitive L-Systems. Based on the evaluation of the proposed visual language framework, it has been shown to be effective in the sense that anyone who does not have prior knowledge in L-System music may also fully utilize the easily generated musical sound based on the original L-System concepts.},

The actuators are fabricated from silicone polymer, liquid metal (LM) alloy (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn), and magnetic (NdFeB) powder. They are small, intrinsically deformable, and can be fabricated using simple techniques. The central elements of the actuators are fine, 3D helical coil conductors, which are used as electromagnetic inductors. The coils are formed from stretchable filaments that are filled with a LM alloy. To achieve high power densities, the filaments themselves may be fabricated from colloids of EGaIn microdroplets in a silicone polymer matrix, allowing them to dissipate heat and accommodate high currents, and thus high forces. Millimeter-scale cylindrical actuators are demonstrated for linear high frequency motion and articulated devices for bending motion. These actuators are applied in a vibrotactile feedback display and in a miniature soft robotic gripper. Miniature soft electromagnetic actuators are presented for applications in robotics.

Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it, which are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a way for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space of 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of behaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover simple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range of natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate visualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically.

abstract = {Abstract Soft robots offer many advantages over traditional rigid robots. However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical- average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot. A},

For evolutionary techniques to scale to the complexities necessary for actual engineering problems, it has been argued that generative systems, where the genotype is an algorithm for constructing the final design, should be used as the encoding. We describe a system for creating generative specifications by combining Lindenmayer systems with evolutionary algorithms, and we apply it to the problem of generating table designs. Designs evolved by our system reach an order of magnitude more parts than previous generative systems. Comparing it against a non-generative encoding, we find that the generative system produces designs with higher fitness and is faster than the non-generative system. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our system to go from design to manufacture by constructing evolved table designs using rapid prototyping equipment},
