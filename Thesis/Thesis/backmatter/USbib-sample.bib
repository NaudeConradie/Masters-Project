abstract = {Reactive systems are often described by interconnecting sub-components along architectural connectors defining communication policies. Generally, such global systems may exhibit properties, often called "emergent properties", that cannot be anticipated just from a complete knowledge of components. These emergent properties are twofold: (1) the global system can question properties attached to components; (2) some global properties cannot be inferred only from a complete knowledge of components, but for being inferred, need the knowledge of cooperation mechanisms between components. In practice, properties of the second form combine knowledge inherited from components. Thus, they are often defined in a richer language than the ones associated to each component and the presence of such emergent properties is quite natural. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to reactive systems described by means of transition systems as components and of the usual synchronous product as architectural connector and whose behavior is expressed by logical properties over a modal first-order logic. In this framework, we propose to study complexity of reactive systems through this notion of emergent properties and we will give some conditions to guarantee when a system has not emergent properties of the first form.},

abstract = {Shape-memory polymers are an emerging class of active polymers that have dual-shape capability. They can change their shape in a predefined way from shape A to shape B when exposed to an appropriate stimulus. While shape B is given by the initial processing step, shape A is determined by applying a process called programming. We review fundamental aspects of the molecular design of suitable polymer architectures, tailored programming and recovery processes, and the quantification of the shape-memory effect. Shape-memory research was initially founded on the thermally induced dual-shape effect. This concept has been extended to other stimuli by either indirect thermal actuation or direct actuation by addressing stimuli-sensitive groups on the molecular level. Finally, polymers are introduced that can be multifunctional. Besides their dual-shape capability, these active materials are biofunctional or biodegradable. Potential applications for such materials as active medical devices are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The review is performed by using well-defined performance criteria with a direction to identify the exemplary and potential applications. In addition to this, initial guidelines to compare the performance and applicability of these novel actuators are provided. The meta-analysis is restricted to five main types of actuators: shape memory alloys (SMAs), fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs), shape morphing polymers (SMPs), dielectric electro-activated polymers (DEAPs), and magnetic/electro-magnetic actuators (E/MAs). In exploring and comparing the capabilities of these actuators, the focus was on eight different aspects: compliance, topology-geometry, scalability-complexity, energy efficiency, operation range, modality, controllability, and technological readiness level (TRL). The overview presented here provides a state-of-the-art summary of the advancements and can help researchers to select the most convenient soft actuators using the comprehensive comparison of the suggested quantitative and qualitative criteria.},

abstract = {One of th e hallm arks of hum an intelligence is the ability to design. An early stage in design, called conceptual design, is concerned with the generation of prelim Â­ inary designs. In this stage, the designer focuses only on the gross structure of the artifact to be designed. To facilitate th e differential analysis perform ed in the stages following conceptual design, approaches to conceptual design th a t system atically define and explore the space of candidate designs are needed. This thesis describes a com putational m ethod for generative design, called Com positional Model-based Design (CMD), which uses a dom ain model describing the com ponents and their interactions to design complex physical devices having desired behaviors. G enerative model-based approaches for the conceptual design of physical devices face challenging problems specifically when devices w ith conjunctive behaviors in a region or devices w ith m ultiple operating regions are to be designed. For th e design of devices w ith conjunctive behavior in a region, the design process m ust confront problems due to interaction between the causal mechanisms th a t establish the individual behaviors. For the design of devices w ith m ultiple operating regions, the design process m ust confront the problem of dynam ically shifting the causal mechanisms th a t establish behaviors in one region to those th at establish the behaviors in the succeeding region when transition conditions are m et. To system atically handle the design of such complex devices, CMD makes use of: i) design fragm ent representation, an abstract qualitative representation of how a physical design establishes its behavior, and ii) verification criteria, a declarative specification of the conditions th a t the design fragm ent m ust satisfy for the qualitative correctness of the design solutions obtained from the representation. CMD restricts the search by constructing approxim ately correct design fragm ents th a t satisfy the desired behavior based on simplifications of the verification criteria. I Such simplifications are then potential sources of incorrectness when the fragm ents ,ix, are composed or extended. CMD focuses the search for design fragm ent revisions by making use of inform ation obtained from verification analysis to pinpoint the sources of incorrectness and focus on the necessary revisions. T he overall search strategy adopted in CMD for generative design of devices is based on divide-and-conquer and increm ental revision. The m ethod divides the specified behavior into separate fragments and constructs approxim ately correct design fragm ents for each. The design fragm ents are then increm entally composed until a design for th e entire specified behavior is obtained. The composition of independently designed fragm ents may result in a design which, due to adverse interactions between the fragm ents, violates the behavior established by one or m ore of them . CMD detects such interactions by perform ing verification analysis and deriving failure conditions th a t specify the reasons for the incorrectness of a design fragm ent. Such failure conditions are then used to guide the search for design fragm ent revisions th a t lead to re-establishm ent of the desired behavior. CMD has been im plem ented in a program and has been dem onstrated for the conceptual design of liquid-level regulation system s, early steam engines and boiler control systems.},

abstract = {3D printing, more formally known as additive manufacturing (AM), has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry, with foreseeable benefits including greater structural efficiency, reduction in material consumption and wastage, streamlining and expedition of the design-build process, enhanced customisation, greater architectural freedom and improved accuracy and safety on-site. Unlike traditional manufacturing methods for construction products, metal 3D printing offers ready opportunities to create non-prismatic sections, internal stiffening, openings, functionally graded elements, variable microstructures and mechanical properties through controlled heating and cooling and thermally-induced prestressing. Additive manufacturing offers many opportunities for the construction sector, but there will also be fresh challenges and demands, such as the need for more digitally savvy engineers, greater use of advanced computational analysis and a new way of thinking for the design and verification of structures, with greater emphasis on inspection and load testing. It is envisaged that AM will complement, rather than replace, conventional production processes, with clear potential for hybrid solutions and structural strengthening and repairs. These opportunities and challenges are explored in this paper as part of a wider review of different methods of metal 3D printing, research and early applications of additive manufacturing in the construction industry. Lessons learnt for metal 3D printing in construction from additive manufacturing using other materials and in other industries are also presented.},

abstract = {Soft robots have become increasingly popular in recent years - and justifiably so. Their compliant structures and (theoretically) infinite degrees of freedom allow them to undertake tasks which would be impossible for their rigid body counterparts, such as conforming to uneven surfaces, efficiently distributing stress, and passing through small apertures. Previous work in the automated deign of soft robots has shown examples of these squishy creatures performing traditional robotic task like locomoting over flat ground. However, designing soft robots for traditional robotic tasks fails to fully utilize their unique advantages. In this work, we present the first example of a soft robot evolutionarily designed for reaching or squeezing through a small aperture - a task naturally suited to its type of morphology. We optimize these creatures with the CPPN-NEAT evolutionary algorithm, introducing a novel implementation of the algorithm which includes multi-objective optimization while retaining its speciation feature for diversity maintenance. We show that more compliant and deformable soft robots perform more effectively at this task than their less flexible counterparts. This work serves mainly as a proof of concept, but we hope that it helps to open the door for the better matching of tasks with appropriate morphologies in robotic design in the future. {\&}copy; 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with diâµerent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at diâµerent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM). The main goal of this paper is to design multiscale basis functions within GMsFEM framework such that the convergence of method is independent of the contrast and linearly decreases with respect to mesh size if oversampling size is appropriately chosen. We would like to show a mesh-dependent convergence with a minimal number of basis functions. Our construction starts with an auxiliary multiscale space by solving local spectral problems. In auxiliary multiscale space, we select the basis functions that correspond to small (contrast-dependent) eigenvalues. These basis functions represent the channels (high-contrast features that connect the boundaries of the coarse block). Using the auxiliary space, we propose a constraint energy minimization to construct multiscale spaces. The minimization is performed in the oversampling domain, which is larger than the target coarse block. The constraints allow handling non-decaying components of the local minimizers. If the auxiliary space is correctly chosen, we show that the convergence rate is independent of the contrast (because the basis representing the channels are included in the auxiliary space) and is proportional to the coarse-mesh size (because the constraints handle non-decaying components of the local minimizers). The oversampling size weakly depends on the contrast as our analysis shows. The convergence theorem requires that channels are not aligned with the coarse edges, which hold in many applications, where the channels are oblique with respect to the coarse-mesh geometry. The numerical results confirm our theoretical results. In particular, we show that if the oversampling domain size is not sufficiently large, the errors are large. To remove the contrast-dependence of the oversampling size, we propose a modified construction for basis functions and present numerical results and the analysis.},

Unfortunately, the notions and terms are not especially well defined: ideas of evolution, self-organization, collective ('systemic') properties and cooperative behaviour are all involved to a greater or lesser extent. It is often claimed that emergent properties arise at a particular level of system description by virtue of the interaction of relatively simple lower-level components- between themselves and with the environment- but cannot be explained at this lower level. Yet there are obvious scientific and philosophical problems with a definition based on an inability to explain observable effects in particular terms.

The actuators are fabricated from silicone polymer, liquid metal (LM) alloy (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn), and magnetic (NdFeB) powder. They are small, intrinsically deformable, and can be fabricated using simple techniques. The central elements of the actuators are fine, 3D helical coil conductors, which are used as electromagnetic inductors.

To achieve high power densities, the filaments themselves may be fabricated from colloids of EGaIn microdroplets in a silicone polymer matrix, allowing them to dissipate heat and accommodate high currents, and thus high forces. Millimeter-scale cylindrical actuators are demonstrated for linear high frequency motion and articulated devices for bending motion. These actuators are applied in a vibrotactile feedback display and in a miniature soft robotic gripper. Miniature soft electromagnetic actuators are presented for applications in robotics.

abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators form part of the growing field of soft robots being used in areas not suited to conventional hard-linked robots. Applications include low-cost automation, wearable technology, and the handling of easily damaged produce/goods. Typically these actuators are manufactured as cast silicone bodies and are powered by compressed air. This research set out to develop methods whereby these actuators can be designed to best represent a desired behaviour and behavioural responses not previously possible. A bimodal actuator was developed where the bending direction can be altered by changes to the internal pressure. This allows non-trivial behaviour whilst using a single pressure source. A layer of a specially developed bilinear material facilitates this response. This bilinear material utilises a strain limiter crimped to an initial condition. As the paper layer decrimps, the response becomes stiffer and approximates that of the reinforcing paper layer. This change in stiffness allows for the preferential bending direction of the actuator to change. An additional stream of research focused on a modular actuator construction made up of smaller articulating units in series. These units are constructed to have a preferential bending direction. By changing the orientation of each unit, a different deformed actuator shape can be made. A ii ABSTRACT iii design tool was developed where a genetic algorithm was coupled with a nonlinear finite element solver. This design tool optimises the design using the genetic information available in the initial population over multiple generations and presents a candidate that best resembles a desired profile specified as the objective function. A 2D reduced-order model was developed that reduces the time for each function evaluation from  20 min for a 3D numerical analysis, to  45 s. The design tool was tasked to solve design targets ranging from sin and cos functions of various amplitudes to final actuator tip positions. In each case, the inflated actuator resembled the desired profile. Five of these designs were manufactured using an aluminium mould with 0.02mm tolerances. The inflated actuators were 3D scanned and qualitatively compared to their numerical counterparts. The overall deformation shape of the physical models closely resembled that of the numerical models.},

abstract = {The design of a pneumatically actuated silicone module, resembling soft tissue, with three pneumatic chambers is considered and optimized in this study with the aim of using it in a soft robot arm for robotic surgery applications. Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the ballooning effect in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the shape of the pneumatic channel cross section, the ratio of channel length to module length, the distance of channel from the module wall, and the ratio of channel to module cross-sectional area. After FEA design optimization yielded least ballooning for pneumatic chambers of semicircular cross section, an internal dragonskin structure was added internally below the module surface to enable and guide the bending under one-channel pneumatic actuation and further contain the ballooning effect: the benefits of this design were successfully verified under both FEA and experimental analysis.},

This approach replaces genetic rebirth as previously proposed by other authors, thereby signifcantly reducing computational costs. As a pure discrete method, the R-GA method does not require heuristic arguments or approximations. This makes the algorithm highly effective when buckling and slenderness constraints with scatter in the data are introduced. A large set of numerical test examples is used to illustrate the capabilities of the method. The algorithm is shown to be effective and robust, making it suitable for the optimal design of very large truss structures.},

abstract = {The biological information coming from electrophysiologic sensors like ECG, pulse sensor or from molecular signal devices like NMR spectrometry has to be visualized and manipulated in a compressed way for an efficient medical use by clinicians, if stored in scientific data bases or in personalized patient records repositories. Here, we define a new transform called Dynalet based on LieÂ´nard ordinary differential equations susceptible to model the mechanism at the source of the studied signal, and we propose to apply this new technique first to the modelling and compression of real biological periodic signals like ECG and pulse rhythm. We consider that the cardiovascular activity results from the summation of cellular oscillators located in the cardiac sinus node and we show that, as a result, the van der Pol oscillator (a particular LieÂ´nard system) fits well the ECG signal and the pulse signal. The reconstruction of the original signal (pulse or ECG) using Dynalet transform is then compared with that of Fourier, counting the number of parameters to be set for obtaining an expected signal-to-noise ratio. Then, we apply the Dynalet transform to the modelling and compression of molecular spectra obtained by protein NMR spectroscopy. The reconstruc- tion of the original signal (peak) using Dynalet transform is again compared with that of Fourier. After reconstructing visually the peak, we propose to periodize the signal and give it to hear, the whole process being called the protein ââstethoscope".},

abstract = {The presence of water vapor clouds in the stratosphere produces warming in excess of tropospheric greenhouse warming, via radiative warming in the lower stratosphere. The stratospheric clouds form only in regions of very low temperature and so the warming produced by the clouds is concentrated in polar winter regions. Results from a paleoclimate modeling study that includes idealized, prescribed polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) show that the clouds cause up to 20 degrees C of warming at high latitude surfaces of the winter hemisphere, with greatest impact in oceanic regions where sea ice is reduced. The modeled temperature response suggests that PSCs may have been a significant climate forcing factor for past time intervals associated with high concentrations of atmospheric methane. The clouds and associated warming may help to explain long-standing discrepancies between model-produced paleotemperatures and geologic proxy temperature interpretations at high latitudes, a persistent problem in studies of ancient greenhouse climates.},

These beams were automatically fabricated, and their physical performance was confirmed within 0.5-7.6{\%} accuracy. We then demonstrate the automatic design of freeform soft robots for forward locomotion using soft volumetrically expanding actuator materials. One robot was fabricated automatically and assembled, and its performance was confirmed with 15{\%} error.

For evolutionary techniques to scale to the complexities necessary for actual engineering problems, it has been argued that generative systems, where the genotype is an algorithm for constructing the final design, should be used as the encoding. We describe a system for creating generative specifications by combining Lindenmayer systems with evolutionary algorithms, and we apply it to the problem of generating table designs. Designs evolved by our system reach an order of magnitude more parts than previous generative systems. Comparing it against a non-generative encoding, we find that the generative system produces designs with higher fitness and is faster than the non-generative system.

Previous review papers have generally covered the topics of materials, manufacturing processes, actuator modeling and control, and current trends. Here, we focus on recent developments in soft robotic applications for the medical field including advances in cardiac devices, surgical robots, and soft rehabilitation and assistance devices. In medical applications, soft robotic devices not only expedite the evolution of minimally invasive surgery but also improve the bio-compatibility of rehabilitation and assistance devices. Here, we evaluate design requirements, mechanisms, achievements and challenges in these key areas. Of particular note, this paper concludes with a discussion on advances in 3D printing and adapting neural networks for modeling and control frameworks that have facilitated the development of faster and less expensive soft medical devices.

To account for this, an inverse analysis is employed that determines not only the constitutive material model parameter values but also the displacement boundary conditions that best replicate the experimental data. The unknown boundary displacement history is approached using a systematically rened piecewise linear approximation , determined alongside material parameter values. The systematic simultaneous estimation of material parameter values and boundary approximations is also investigated using a virtual problem for which the exact solution is known. This investigation conrms that known material parameter values and boundary conditions can be recovered without using any prior knowledge of the exact displacement boundary conditions .},

abstract = {Traditional methods of generative design for structural design applications typically utilise ?nite element analysis or other resource intensive methods. A more e?cient method of design generation is needed in order for generative design to be utilised for these applications. A generative design method is presented, utilising reduced-order modelling, Lindenmayer-systems and numerical optimisation. Through the use of recur- sive design techniques, this method reduces the computational cost of gen- erating structural designs and through numerical optimisation is capable of developing targeted designs, using a genetic algorithm. This method was applied to generate soft robotic bending actuator designs. The actuator is assembled from 15 modular cells and targeted for maximum bending, vertical and horizontal extension. An idealised reduced-order model is developed for the modular cells and reduced the evaluation runtime of the designs by a factor of approximately 6600. In all target objectives, the gener- ated designs produced comparable results to a full 3D ?nite element model. Soft robotic bending actuator designs for grasping various di?erent objects were also developed. Grasping was prescribed through curve ?tting of the actuator to the object. All designs generated exhibited successful grasping of the objects of di?erent sizes and positioned at di?erent locations.},

However, many of the existing L-System modelling applications, especially for musical rendering do not cater a larger circle of people who may not be well-versed in music and neither for those with programming skill nor prior knowledge in L-Systems. In this paper, a visual programming framework is proposed for L-System music rendering in order to cater a larger circle of people including non-experts in L-System and music. A visual language framework for L-System has been developed and the usefulness and the efficiency of visual language in L-System music rendering have also been studied. The visual language framework includes the L-System attributes and standard musical grammar rules in the form of simplified icon-based visual language. Furthermore, the music rendering has also been further fine-tuned by using stochastic and context-sensitive L-Systems. Based on the evaluation of the proposed visual language framework, it has been shown to be effective in the sense that anyone who does not have prior knowledge in L-System music may also fully utilize the easily generated musical sound based on the original L-System concepts.},

abstract = {A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multi-criteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer's work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Generative design develops complex forms and structures similar to those found in nature, taking advantage of automated tasks and high-scale computing power. This approach benefits designers in the creation systems that are efficient, resilient and visually engaging. These systems follow specific rules for form generation and meet clear design goals in terms of shape, strength, mass, and other physical attributes. There is a large number of methods for creating generative systems, based on establishing desired outcomes and behaviors for how components relate to each other. Examples of methods include L-Systems, Shape Grammars, Swarm Intelligence, Form Optimization, Lattice Design, and many others. From a designer's point of view, most of the approaches fall into two categories: by subtraction and addition. In a subtractive process, objects are analyzed based on specific targets for strength, mass or similar attributes, and any sections that are unnecesary to satisfy them are removed. An additive approach predefines design goals and constraints for a given problem and generates large number of iterations of potential solutions that meet such goals. Subtractive processes have relatively small learning curves but they tend to offer only incremental improvements over current solutions. Additive processes provide more benefits and flexibility for form generation and automation of processes but their steep learning curve makes them hard to use, discouraging designers without adequate knowledge on mathematics and programming. While the use of any of these two approaches provides great potential for design development, it is common for designers to pick one of the two approaches early in their development process and not make an effort to include the other approach along the way. The combination of subractive and additive methods, however, can lead to solutions that are more effective and cohesive. This paper discusses an integrated method based on iterative design processes where designers refine their concepts multiple times, achieving higher levels of success. This integrated, iterative process puts designers at the center of the process, providing tools with varied benefits and levels of complexity, that maximize automation and computational processing power.},

However, conventional meniscal substitutes are not 3D-printable and lack the customizability of 3D printed implants and are not mechanically robust enough for human implantation. Similarly, 3D printed hydrogel scaffolds suffer from drawbacks of being mechanically weak and as a result patients are unable to execute immediate post-surgical weight-bearing ambulation and rehabilitation. To solve this problem, we have developed a 3D silicone meniscus implant which is (1) cytocompatible, (2) resistant to cyclic loading and mechanically similar to native meniscus, and (3) directly 3D printable. The main focus of this study is to determine whether the purity, composition, structure, dimensions and mechanical properties of silicone implants are affected by the use of a custom-made in-house 3D-printer. We have used the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) absorption test, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, surface profilometry, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to effectively assess and compare material properties between molded and 3D printed silicone samples.},

abstract = {This work provides approaches to designing and fabricating soft fluidic elastomer robots. That is, three viable actuator morphologies composed entirely from soft silicone rubber are explored, and these morphologies are differentiated by their internal channel structure, namely, ribbed, cylindrical, and pleated. Additionally, three distinct casting-based fabrication processes are explored: lamination-based casting, retractable-pin-based casting, and lost-wax-based casting. Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF robot are explored: casting the complete robot as a whole and casting single degree of freedom (DOF) segments with subsequent concatenation. We experimentally validate each soft actuator morphology and fabrication process by creating multiple physical soft robot prototypes.},

abstract = {The development of soft pneumatic actuators based on composites consisting of elastomers with embedded sheet or fiber structures (e.g., paper or fabric) that are flexible but not extensible is described. On pneumatic inflation, these actuators move anisotropically, based on the motions accessible by their composite structures. They are inexpensive, simple to fabricate, light in weight, and easy to actuate. This class of structure is versatile: the same principles of design lead to actuators that respond to pressurization with a wide range of motions (bending, extension, contraction, twisting, and others). Paper, when used to introduce anisotropy into elastomers, can be readily folded into 3D structures following the principles of origami; these folded structures increase the stiffness and anisotropy of the elastomeric actuators, while being light in weight. These soft actuators can manipulate objects with moderate performance; for example, they can lift loads up to 120 times their weight. They can also be combined with other components, for example, electrical components, to increase their functionality. {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {Electroactive polymer (EAP) actuators, also known as artificial muscles, have remarkable properties such as low energy consumption, low weight, low actuation foot-print, compliance and bio-compatibility. Several methodologies have been proposed to model and analyse their quasi-static bending behaviour with negligible attention paid to their dynamic behaviour. We, therefore, report on an enhanced methodology to model their highly non-linear bending behaviour by treating them as smart and soft robotic manipulators. The methodology consists of an inverse kinematic model and a dynamic model. The proposed methodology accurately estimates the EAP actuator's whole shape deflection using optimization-based inverse kinematic solutions integrated with an electro-mechanical dynamic model. The experimental and numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the soft robotic manipulator model in estimating the highly non-linear bending behaviour of the polypyrrole electroactive polymer (PPy-EAP) actuators. The proposed methodology can easily be extended to other bending type actuators and active smart manipulators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for the dimensional reduction of the models of hyperelastic solids undergoing large strains. Unlike standard proper orthogonal decomposition methods, the proposed algorithm minimizes the use of the Newton algorithms in the search of non-linear equilibrium paths of elastic bodies. The proposed technique is based upon two main ingredients. On one side, the use of classic proper orthogonal decomposition techniques, that extract the most valuable information from pre-computed, complete models. This information is used to build global shape functions in a Ritz-like framework. On the other hand, to reduce the use of Newton procedures, an asymptotic expansion is made for some variables of interest. This expansion shows the interesting feature of possessing one unique tangent operator for all the terms of the expansion, thus minimizing the updating of the tangent stiffness matrix of the problem. The paper is completed with some numerical examples in order to show the performance of the technique in the framework of hyperelastic (KirchhoffâSaint Venant and neo-Hookean) solids.},

@article{Ogden1972,
abstract = {Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically the stressâstrain curves obtained from experiments on the isothermal deformation of highly elastic ârubberlike' materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has usually been postulated, and the simplifications appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which: (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to be amenable to mathematical analysis. A strain-energy function which is a linear combination of strain invariants defined by Ï ( $\alpha$ ) = ( a 1 $\alpha$ + a 2 $\alpha$ + a 3 $\alpha$ â3)/ $\alpha$ is proposed; and the principal stretches a 1 , a 2 and a 3 are used as independent variables subject to the incompressibility constraint a 1 a 2 a 3 = 1. Principal axes techniques are used where appropriate. An excellent agreement between this theory and the experimental data from simple tension, pure shear and equibiaxial tension tests is demonstrated. It is also shown that the present theory has certain repercussions in respect of the constitutive inequality proposed by Hill (1968 a , 1970 b ).},

This algorithm is capable of selecting the number of components of the model using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. Our approach benefits from the properties of Genetic algorithms (GA) and the EM algorithm by combination of both into a single procedure. The population-based stochastic search of the GA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables escaping from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. The GA-EM algorithm is elitist which maintains the monotonic convergence property of the EM algorithm. The experiments on simulated and real data show that the GA-EM outperforms the EM method since: 1) We have obtained a better MDL score while using exactly the same termination condition for both algorithms. 2) Our approach identifies the number of components which were used to generate the underlying data more often than the EM algorithm.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft robots offer many advantages over traditional rigid robots. However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical- average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot. A},

abstract = {Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are attractive materials due to their unique mechanical properties, including high deformation capacity and shape recovery. SMPs are easier to process, lightweight, and inexpensive compared to their metallic counterparts, shape memory alloys. However, SMPs are limited to relatively small form factors due to their low recovery stresses. Lightweight, micro-architected composite SMPs may overcome these size limitations and offer the ability to combine functional properties (e.g., electrical conductivity) with shape memory behavior. Fabrication of 3D SMP thermoset structures via traditional manufacturing methods is challenging, especially for designs that are composed of multiple materials within porous microarchitectures designed for specific shape change strategies, e.g. sequential shape recovery. We report thermoset SMP composite inks containing some materials from renewable resources that can be 3D printed into complex, multi-material architectures that exhibit programmable shape changes with temperature and time. Through addition of fiber-based fillers, we demonstrate printing of electrically conductive SMPs where multiple shape states may induce functional changes in a device and that shape changes can be actuated via heating of printed composites. The ability of SMPs to recover their original shapes will be advantageous for a broad range of applications, including medical, aerospace, and robotic devices.},

Owing to their structure-inherent compliance, soft robots are also credited with being able to bridge the gap between humans and autonomous machines. However, for soft robots to become mass-producible in future days, rapid design and modeling tools are indispensable. Currently, the need for fast and versatile development tools is contradicted by a design flow that is mainly driven by experiments. To counter the perceived gap between experimentally and simulation driven research in soft robotics, we have developed a finite element based kinematic modeling framework for soft continuum robots that is applicable to a range of different designs. The corresponding design and modeling tool effectively combines the capabilities of both MATLAB and Abaqus via a Python interface. In this paper, we provide detailed description of the developed methodology and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on a soft pneumatic actuator.},

Pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. The winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counter-strategies emerge.},

abstract = {This paper describes a novel system for creating virtual creatures that move and behave in simulated three-dimensional physical worlds. The morphologies of creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both generated automatically using genetic algorithms. Different fitness evaluation functions are used to direct simulated evolutions towards specific behaviors such as swimming, walking, jumping, and following. A genetic language is presented that uses nodes and connections as its primitive elements to represent directed graphs, which are used to describe both the morphology and the neural circuitry of these creatures. This genetic language defines a hyperspace containing an indefinite number of possible creatures with behaviors, and when it is searched using optimization techniques, a variety of successful and interesting locomotion strategies emerge, some of which would be difficult to invent or build by design.},

abstract = {Complex networks are all around us, and they can be generated by simple mechanisms. Understanding what kinds of networks can be produced by following simple rules is therefore of great importance. We investigate this issue by studying the dynamics of extremely simple systems where are `writer' moves around a network, and modifies it in a way that depends upon the writer's surroundings. Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it, which are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a way for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space of 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of behaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover simple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range of natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate visualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically. We arrive at an empirical classification scheme which reveals a lot about the kinds of dynamics and networks that can be generated by these systems.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

@article{Villoslada2014,
abstract = {This paper describes a flexible Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator designed to increase the limited displacement that these alloys can induce. The SMA actuator has been designed so that it can be bent up to about 180Â°, providing more freedom of movements and a better integration in wearable robots, specially in soft wearable robots, than standard rigid solutions. Although the actuator length is relatively short, this original design allows a great linear displacement, because it can have one or more loops of the same SMA wire inside the actuator. This implies that the length of the SMA wire is at least two times greater than the length of the actuator. The adopted strategy for both position and speed control that overcomes the hysteresis and prevents overheating the actuator is also described. The control algorithm has been implemented in a rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on a low cost hardware platform. Finally, the application of this novel actuator in a wrist exoskeleton prototype is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of using the flexible SMA actuator in a real soft wearable robot.},

abstract = {Soft robotics is a fast-emerging interdisciplinary field combining mechatronics, control, material science and biomimet-ics. With their unique inherent compliance feature, soft robots have advantages over rigid-bodied robots for operations in unstructured environments. On the other hand, most soft robots reported to date are laboratory prototypes rather than end products. To fill this gap, they must undergo multiple transitions from an engineering perspective, through which soft robots are optimised in design, fabrication, power, control, and other engineering criteria, and be proven of their application worthiness. This paper compares conventional soft robotic technologies with the latest developments, and reviews the most recent advances of several engineering-oriented aspects of soft robotics research: fabrication technique standardisation which helps improve the repeatability and reliability of soft actuators; modelling and characterisation from both theoretical and simulation approaches which allow for the systematic analysis of soft robot behaviour and performance; evaluation works on soft actuator drive and power methods which provide insights into how to energise and optimise for the most suitable soft robot for a particular application; untethering soft robots which further relax their physical limitations and enable operations over a greater distance across all-terrain, all-habitat environments; and other factors such as actuation speed, fatigue, and failure modes.},

@article{Yan2018,
abstract = {Soft robot has become a hot topic recently due to its distinct advantages over traditional rigid robots such as high deformability and good impact resistance. However, the coupled deflections of flexile materials bring challenges to soft robotic research in many aspects such as kinematic modeling, dynamic analysis, and control. Besides, unwanted deformations might enlarge external dimensions of soft robots, causing a reduction in the efficiency and bringing about unexpected or harmful contacts with surrounding environments that will significantly affect the robots' performance. In this study, we propose a new inflatable soft actuator driven by two spiral chambers twined with fibers for the first time. A key feature of this actuator is that it possesses a pure and high-efficient torsional motion with no bending and extension movements when works without load, which reduces the difficulties of theoretical analysis and control to some extent. Kinematic model is established by combining virtual work principle and elastic strain energy function for nonlinear flexible materials. The new soft torsional actuator module is carefully designed and fabricated, of which both the kinematic property and output torque are investigated experimentally. Results show that the module exhibits good linearity with air pressure ranging from 35 to 100 kPa, and can provide a torsion angle of up to 110Â° with an angular displacement accuracy of Â±2Â° in empty loaded conditions; the maximum output torque reaches 0.026 N{\textperiodcentered}m with the corresponding air pressure of 100 kPa. Finally, three soft robots are assembled by utilizing this new, inflatable, pure, soft torsional actuator, and successfully carry out different manipulating tasks. This work might provide some insights into the design of linear soft actuators without coupled deformations in future.},
