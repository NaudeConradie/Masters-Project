    Milestone 1

    10x10 empty grid with pressure all around inner surface

    Simple elements

    Either EcoFlex or Smooth Sil 950

    Print a physical model and compare its behaviour to modeled behaviour


    Milestone 2

    General case


    Start journal to keep track of decisions and changes, such as mesh sizes and element
    numbers'}

    Don''t write like skripsie

    Use recorder as well as taking notes during feedback sessions


    Prof Venter:

    As good as you can get it

    Thorough and pedantic feedback

    Don''t give rough work


    Dr Venter:

    Sees different things from Prof Venter

    Doesn''t notice spelling errors'}

    Use consistent formatting (Capital letters, bold, italics, underline, etc.)

    Keep it simple; explain immportant terms to unfamiliar audience

    Use nice pictures, crop out unnecessary parts

    Use a nice template (not skripsie template)'}

    Basic set of known inputs and outputs used to check if function is behaving as

    Writing tips

    Start writing in this year

    Write as you go along

    Submit chapter by chapter for feedback

    Don''t be shy with images/graphs'}
27: {text: 'Implementation of 10x10 empty square:

    Use Mold-Star 15 material

    Use symmetry constraints to bound the material

    Download and install NX 12, Marc Mentat, and LSDynam

    Model square on all those

    Look at examples in the manuals and online

    Use linear properties first for an isotropic model, then change the material model

    Look at and understand time transience of the model


    Set up a VPN to use the software away from the office


    Work through PolyFEM by Jorgen Bergstrom


    Presentation:

    Present narrative of project as a whole

    Generate locomotives

    Using recursive smal elements with simple properties to obtain more complex behaviours
    and emergent properties like David and Izaak

    Build individual components

    Use boundary energy minimization

    10x10 NX12 Model

    1D Model:

    Standard setup

    45 mm length lines (50+40/2)

    5 elements per line

    10N along curve inwards

    PBeam bar (10mmx10mm)

    Steel


    2D Model

    Standard setup

    50 mm outer lines, 40 mm inner lines, 10 mm breadth

    Extrusion 10 mm (-5 mm, 5 mm)

    Midsection between planes to get 2D shell elements (outer and inner plane to get
    shell pointing outward, to apply pressure)

    10 mm elements resulting in 10 square elements

    10 MPa per side
