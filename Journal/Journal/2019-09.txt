11: {text: 'Explicit FEM

    Many small timesteps

    Better for non-linearity


    Implicit FEM

    Larger timesteps with multiple iterations at each timestep


    Do proper literature early on'}

    10x10 Model

    Set as 2D solid


    Non-linear solver:

    Don''t use 106 or 129, rather use 601 or 701


    601:

    Static/implicit

    No velocity or inertia

    Generates a stiffness matrix and solves for it

    If a solution is obtained, it is correct


    701:

    Explicit

    Always obtains a solution, but may not always be correct
