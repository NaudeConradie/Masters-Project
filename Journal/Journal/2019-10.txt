    - David''s thesis - expensive function evaluation

    - Izaak''s literature - generative encoding

    - Bridge gap between David''s and Izaak''s work



    Project scope

    - Automate the design of shape-changing soft robots

    - Go from an initial shape to a final shape due to a change in internal pressure

    - Restricted to 2D for now

    - Using non-linear FEM and a non-linear material model

    - Use computationally efficient recycled information

    - Recursion and the reuse of data

    - L-systems vs CPPNs (more flexible and computationally costly)

    - GA vs agent-based competitive population



    medium.com

    CPPNs



    Objective 1

    - Goal of the robot (gripper, aerospace)



    Book reading

    - Generate a mind map that describes all the topics

    - Work down from a high level to a low level



    Read L-systems book over the weekend



    Try implicit solver in LSDyna



    Generate primitive shapes and shape changes

    - Given some initial shape, find some maximum variation

    - Prercriptive

    - Define function evaluation

    - Manipulate the grid and apply internal pressure

    - Parameterize it

    - Use either a LS PrePost Macro or Python'}
