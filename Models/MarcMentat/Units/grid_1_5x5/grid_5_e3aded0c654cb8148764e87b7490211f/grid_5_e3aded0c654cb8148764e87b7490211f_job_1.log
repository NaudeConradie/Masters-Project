             The MSC password security has determined that
             you are not allowed to run on this machine; possible reasons
             are:
             
             1) the choice of machine or current OS level is not
                compliant with the passwords;
             2) the file "license.dat" in the MSC
                license directory contains wrong information;
             3) the license directory has wrong access permissions.
             4) all available licenses are in use - contact your local
                MSC Software office to purchase additional licenses.
             5) you are licensed to run AFEA and the interlock
                security has been violated because the input file was
                not created on the same machine or has been editted.
             6) you are licensed to run an educational version and
                the maximum node limit has been exceeded.
