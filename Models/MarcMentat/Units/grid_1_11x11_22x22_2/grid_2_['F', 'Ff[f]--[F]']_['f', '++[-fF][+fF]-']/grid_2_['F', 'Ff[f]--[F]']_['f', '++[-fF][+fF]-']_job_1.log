             Error encountered in stress recovery. The output will reveal
             which element has a particular problem. The error is usually
             due to excessive deformation in the element. Note that this
             can occur during the iterative process, so that it is not
             always possible to visualize the excessive deformation.
             Check the material behavior and the magnitude of the
             incremental loads.
             
             Suggestion :
             ------------
             Activate the cut-back feature if using the AUTO LOAD, AUTO
             STEP or AUTO INCREMENT solution schemes. This will allow the
             analysis to automatically cut down the time step and to try
             again from the end of the last converged increment. For the
             AUTO LOAD procedure, the increment numbers are maintained as
             specified in the input.
