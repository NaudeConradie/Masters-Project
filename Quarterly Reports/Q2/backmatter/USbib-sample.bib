abstract = {Reactive systems are often described by interconnecting sub-components along architectural connectors defining communication policies. Generally, such global systems may exhibit properties, often called "emergent properties", that cannot be anticipated just from a complete knowledge of components. These emergent properties are twofold: (1) the global system can question properties attached to components; (2) some global properties cannot be inferred only from a complete knowledge of components, but for being inferred, need the knowledge of cooperation mechanisms between components. In practice, properties of the second form combine knowledge inherited from components. Thus, they are often defined in a richer language than the ones associated to each component and the presence of such emergent properties is quite natural. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to reactive systems described by means of transition systems as components and of the usual synchronous product as architectural connector and whose behavior is expressed by logical properties over a modal first-order logic. In this framework, we propose to study complexity of reactive systems through this notion of emergent properties and we will give some conditions to guarantee when a system has not emergent properties of the first form.},

abstract = {Shape-memory polymers are an emerging class of active polymers that have dual-shape capability. They can change their shape in a predefined way from shape A to shape B when exposed to an appropriate stimulus. While shape B is given by the initial processing step, shape A is determined by applying a process called programming. We review fundamental aspects of the molecular design of suitable polymer architectures, tailored programming and recovery processes, and the quantification of the shape-memory effect. Shape-memory research was initially founded on the thermally induced dual-shape effect. This concept has been extended to other stimuli by either indirect thermal actuation or direct actuation by addressing stimuli-sensitive groups on the molecular level. Finally, polymers are introduced that can be multifunctional. Besides their dual-shape capability, these active materials are biofunctional or biodegradable. Potential applications for such materials as active medical devices are highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The review is performed by using well-defined performance criteria with a direction to identify the exemplary and potential applications. In addition to this, initial guidelines to compare the performance and applicability of these novel actuators are provided. The meta-analysis is restricted to five main types of actuators: shape memory alloys (SMAs), fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs), shape morphing polymers (SMPs), dielectric electro-activated polymers (DEAPs), and magnetic/electro-magnetic actuators (E/MAs). In exploring and comparing the capabilities of these actuators, the focus was on eight different aspects: compliance, topology-geometry, scalability-complexity, energy efficiency, operation range, modality, controllability, and technological readiness level (TRL). The overview presented here provides a state-of-the-art summary of the advancements and can help researchers to select the most convenient soft actuators using the comprehensive comparison of the suggested quantitative and qualitative criteria.},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with di↵erent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at di↵erent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

Unfortunately, the notions and terms are not especially well defined: ideas of evolution, self-organization, collective ('systemic') properties and cooperative behaviour are all involved to a greater or lesser extent. It is often claimed that emergent properties arise at a particular level of system description by virtue of the interaction of relatively simple lower-level components- between themselves and with the environment- but cannot be explained at this lower level. Yet there are obvious scientific and philosophical problems with a definition based on an inability to explain observable effects in particular terms. This editorial outlines the history of emergence as a scientific concept, and reviews attempts to refine and qualify the term.},

This paper describes the design and fabrication of miniature soft EMAs that operate based on the Lorentz force principle. The actuators are fabricated from silicone polymer, liquid metal (LM) alloy (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn), and magnetic (NdFeB) powder. They are small, intrinsically deformable, and can be fabricated using simple techniques. The central elements of the actuators are fine, 3D helical coil conductors, which are used as electromagnetic inductors. The coils are formed from stretchable filaments that are filled with a LM alloy. To achieve high power densities, the filaments themselves may be fabricated from colloids of EGaIn microdroplets in a silicone polymer matrix, allowing them to dissipate heat and accommodate high currents, and thus high forces. Millimeter-scale cylindrical actuators are demonstrated for linear high frequency motion and articulated devices for bending motion. These actuators are applied in a vibrotactile feedback display and in a miniature soft robotic gripper. Miniature soft electromagnetic actuators are presented for applications in robotics. These devices are based on fine helical inductors fabricated from silicone polymer colloids, liquid metal alloy (EGaIn), and magnetic (NdFeB) powder.

Here, we define a new transform called Dynalet based on Lie´nard ordinary differential equations susceptible to model the mechanism at the source of the studied signal, and we propose to apply this new technique first to the modelling and compression of real biological periodic signals like ECG and pulse rhythm. We consider that the cardiovascular activity results from the summation of cellular oscillators located in the cardiac sinus node and we show that, as a result, the van der Pol oscillator (a particular Lie´nard system) fits well the ECG signal and the pulse signal. The reconstruction of the original signal (pulse or ECG) using Dynalet transform is then compared with that of Fourier, counting the number of parameters to be set for obtaining an expected signal-to-noise ratio. Then, we apply the Dynalet transform to the modelling and compression of molecular spectra obtained by protein NMR spectroscopy. The reconstruc- tion of the original signal (peak) using Dynalet transform is again compared with that of Fourier. After reconstructing visually the peak, we propose to periodize the signal and give it to hear, the whole process being called the protein ‘‘stethoscope".},

abstract = {Generative design develops complex forms and structures similar to those found in nature, taking advantage of automated tasks and high-scale computing power. This approach benefits designers in the creation systems that are efficient, resilient and visually engaging. These systems follow specific rules for form generation and meet clear design goals in terms of shape, strength, mass, and other physical attributes. There is a large number of methods for creating generative systems, based on establishing desired outcomes and behaviors for how components relate to each other. Examples of methods include L-Systems, Shape Grammars, Swarm Intelligence, Form Optimization, Lattice Design, and many others. From a designer's point of view, most of the approaches fall into two categories: by subtraction and addition. In a subtractive process, objects are analyzed based on specific targets for strength, mass or similar attributes, and any sections that are unnecesary to satisfy them are removed. An additive approach predefines design goals and constraints for a given problem and generates large number of iterations of potential solutions that meet such goals. Subtractive processes have relatively small learning curves but they tend to offer only incremental improvements over current solutions. Additive processes provide more benefits and flexibility for form generation and automation of processes but their steep learning curve makes them hard to use, discouraging designers without adequate knowledge on mathematics and programming. While the use of any of these two approaches provides great potential for design development, it is common for designers to pick one of the two approaches early in their development process and not make an effort to include the other approach along the way. The combination of subractive and additive methods, however, can lead to solutions that are more effective and cohesive. This paper discusses an integrated method based on iterative design processes where designers refine their concepts multiple times, achieving higher levels of success. This integrated, iterative process puts designers at the center of the process, providing tools with varied benefits and levels of complexity, that maximize automation and computational processing power.},

Several methodologies have been proposed to model and analyse their quasi-static bending behaviour with negligible attention paid to their dynamic behaviour. We, therefore, report on an enhanced methodology to model their highly non-linear bending behaviour by treating them as smart and soft robotic manipulators. The methodology consists of an inverse kinematic model and a dynamic model. The proposed methodology accurately estimates the EAP actuator's whole shape deflection using optimization-based inverse kinematic solutions integrated with an electro-mechanical dynamic model. The experimental and numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the soft robotic manipulator model in estimating the highly non-linear bending behaviour of the polypyrrole electroactive polymer (PPy-EAP) actuators. The proposed methodology can easily be extended to other bending type actuators and active smart manipulators. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft robots offer many advantages over traditional rigid robots. However, soft robots can be difficult to control with standard control methods. Fortunately, evolutionary algorithms can offer an elegant solution to this problem. Instead of creating controls to handle the intricate dynamics of these robots, we can simply evolve the controls using a simulation to provide an evaluation function. In this article, we show how such a control paradigm can be applied to an emerging field within soft robotics: robots based on tensegrity structures. We take the model of the Spherical Underactuated Planetary Exploration Robot ball (SUPERball), an icosahedron tensegrity robot under production at NASA Ames Research Center, develop a rolling locomotion algorithm, and study the learned behavior using an accurate model of the SUPERball simulated in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit. We first present the historical- average fitness-shaping algorithm for coevolutionary algorithms to speed up learning while favoring robustness over optimality. Second, we use a distributed control approach by coevolving open-loop control signals for each controller. Being simple and distributed, open-loop controllers can be readily implemented on SUPERball hardware without the need for sensor information or precise coordination. We analyze signals of different complexities and frequencies. Among the learned policies, we take one of the best and use it to analyze different aspects of the rolling gait, such as lengths, tensions, and energy consumption. We also discuss the correlation between the signals controlling different parts of the tensegrity robot. A},

abstract = {Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are attractive materials due to their unique mechanical properties, including high deformation capacity and shape recovery. SMPs are easier to process, lightweight, and inexpensive compared to their metallic counterparts, shape memory alloys. However, SMPs are limited to relatively small form factors due to their low recovery stresses. Lightweight, micro-architected composite SMPs may overcome these size limitations and offer the ability to combine functional properties (e.g., electrical conductivity) with shape memory behavior. Fabrication of 3D SMP thermoset structures via traditional manufacturing methods is challenging, especially for designs that are composed of multiple materials within porous microarchitectures designed for specific shape change strategies, e.g. sequential shape recovery. We report thermoset SMP composite inks containing some materials from renewable resources that can be 3D printed into complex, multi-material architectures that exhibit programmable shape changes with temperature and time. Through addition of fiber-based fillers, we demonstrate printing of electrically conductive SMPs where multiple shape states may induce functional changes in a device and that shape changes can be actuated via heating of printed composites. The ability of SMPs to recover their original shapes will be advantageous for a broad range of applications, including medical, aerospace, and robotic devices.},

A more e?cient method of design generation is needed in order for generative design to be utilised for these applications. A generative design method is presented, utilising reduced-order modelling, Lindenmayer-systems and numerical optimisation. Through the use of recur- sive design techniques, this method reduces the computational cost of gen- erating structural designs and through numerical optimisation is capable of developing targeted designs, using a genetic algorithm. This method was applied to generate soft robotic bending actuator designs. The actuator is assembled from 15 modular cells and targeted for maximum bending, vertical and horizontal extension. An idealised reduced-order model is developed for the modular cells and reduced the evaluation runtime of the designs by a factor of approximately 6600. In all target objectives, the gener- ated designs produced comparable results to a full 3D ?nite element model. Soft robotic bending actuator designs for grasping various di?erent objects were also developed. Grasping was prescribed through curve ?tting of the actuator to the object. All designs generated exhibited successful grasping of the objects of di?erent sizes and positioned at di?erent locations.},

abstract = {A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multi-criteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer's work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Natural DNA can encode complexity on an enormous scale. Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed.},

Designs evolved by our system reach an order of magnitude more parts than previous generative systems.

The stratospheric clouds form only in regions of very low temperature and so the warming produced by the clouds is concentrated in polar winter regions. Results from a paleoclimate modeling study that includes idealized, prescribed polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) show that the clouds cause up to 20 degrees C of warming at high latitude surfaces of the winter hemisphere, with greatest impact in oceanic regions where sea ice is reduced. The modeled temperature response suggests that PSCs may have been a significant climate forcing factor for past time intervals associated with high concentrations of atmospheric methane. The clouds and associated warming may help to explain long-standing discrepancies between model-produced paleotemperatures and geologic proxy temperature interpretations at high latitudes, a persistent problem in studies of ancient greenhouse climates.},

abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators form part of the growing field of soft robots being used in areas not suited to conventional hard-linked robots. Applications include low-cost automation, wearable technology, and the handling of easily damaged produce/goods. Typically these actuators are manufactured as cast silicone bodies and are powered by compressed air. This research set out to develop methods whereby these actuators can be designed to best represent a desired behaviour and behavioural responses not previously possible. A bimodal actuator was developed where the bending direction can be altered by changes to the internal pressure. This allows non-trivial behaviour whilst using a single pressure source. A layer of a specially developed bilinear material facilitates this response. This bilinear material utilises a strain limiter crimped to an initial condition. As the paper layer decrimps, the response becomes stiffer and approximates that of the reinforcing paper layer. This change in stiffness allows for the preferential bending direction of the actuator to change. An additional stream of research focused on a modular actuator construction made up of smaller articulating units in series. These units are constructed to have a preferential bending direction. By changing the orientation of each unit, a different deformed actuator shape can be made. A ii ABSTRACT iii design tool was developed where a genetic algorithm was coupled with a nonlinear finite element solver. This design tool optimises the design using the genetic information available in the initial population over multiple generations and presents a candidate that best resembles a desired profile specified as the objective function. A 2D reduced-order model was developed that reduces the time for each function evaluation from  20 min for a 3D numerical analysis, to  45 s. The design tool was tasked to solve design targets ranging from sin and cos functions of various amplitudes to final actuator tip positions. In each case, the inflated actuator resembled the desired profile. Five of these designs were manufactured using an aluminium mould with 0.02mm tolerances. The inflated actuators were 3D scanned and qualitatively compared to their numerical counterparts. The overall deformation shape of the physical models closely resembled that of the numerical models.},

G enerative model-based approaches for the conceptual design of physical devices face challenging problems specifically when devices w ith conjunctive behaviors in a region or devices w ith m ultiple operating regions are to be designed. For th e design of devices w ith conjunctive behavior in a region, the design process m ust confront problems due to interaction between the causal mechanisms th a t establish the individual behaviors. For the design of devices w ith m ultiple operating regions, the design process m ust confront the problem of dynam ically shifting the causal mechanisms th a t establish behaviors in one region to those th at establish the behaviors in the succeeding region when transition conditions are m et. To system atically handle the design of such complex devices, CMD makes use of: i) design fragm ent representation, an abstract qualitative representation of how a physical design establishes its behavior, and ii) verification criteria, a declarative specification of the conditions th a t the design fragm ent m ust satisfy for the qualitative correctness of the design solutions obtained from the representation. CMD restricts the search by constructing approxim ately correct design fragm ents th a t satisfy the desired behavior based on simplifications of the verification criteria. I Such simplifications are then potential sources of incorrectness when the fragm ents ,ix, are composed or extended. CMD focuses the search for design fragm ent revisions by making use of inform ation obtained from verification analysis to pinpoint the sources of incorrectness and focus on the necessary revisions. T he overall search strategy adopted in CMD for generative design of devices is based on divide-and-conquer and increm ental revision. The m ethod divides the specified behavior into separate fragments and constructs approxim ately correct design fragm ents for each. The design fragm ents are then increm entally composed until a design for th e entire specified behavior is obtained. The composition of independently designed fragm ents may result in a design which, due to adverse interactions between the fragm ents, violates the behavior established by one or m ore of them . CMD detects such interactions by perform ing verification analysis and deriving failure conditions th a t specify the reasons for the incorrectness of a design fragm ent. Such failure conditions are then used to guide the search for design fragm ent revisions th a t lead to re-establishm ent of the desired behavior. CMD has been im plem ented in a program and has been dem onstrated for the conceptual design of liquid-level regulation system s, early steam engines and boiler control systems.},

abstract = {It is very difficult that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dementia (PDD) distinguish from PD patients, because PD patients may exhibit patterns of cognitive impairment. Recently, cardiac I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy has been used as tools to distinguish PD from atypical parkinsonism. Thus, we performed this study to confirm significant clinical value of cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy for differential diagnosis between PD and PDD. Cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy was studied in 18 patients with PD, 18 patients with PDD, and 13 normal controls that were matched for age, disease duration, and severity of symptoms. The heart to mediastinum ratio (H/M ratio) was calculated. The mean value of H/M ratio of PDD and PD was significantly lower than normal controls. However, there were no differences between PDD and PD groups. Although cardiac I-123 MIBG scintigraphy did not distinguish PDD from PD, we wish to focus attention on sustained studies that are needed to differentiate other Lewy body disease from many dementia patients with PD features. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Although the existing Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) have been traditionally used to model plant development graphically, it is also possible to interpret L-Systems for music rendering. However, many of the existing L-System modelling applications, especially for musical rendering do not cater a larger circle of people who may not be well-versed in music and neither for those with programming skill nor prior knowledge in L-Systems. In this paper, a visual programming framework is proposed for L-System music rendering in order to cater a larger circle of people including non-experts in L-System and music. A visual language framework for L-System has been developed and the usefulness and the efficiency of visual language in L-System music rendering have also been studied. The visual language framework includes the L-System attributes and standard musical grammar rules in the form of simplified icon-based visual language. Furthermore, the music rendering has also been further fine-tuned by using stochastic and context-sensitive L-Systems. Based on the evaluation of the proposed visual language framework, it has been shown to be effective in the sense that anyone who does not have prior knowledge in L-System music may also fully utilize the easily generated musical sound based on the original L-System concepts.},

abstract = {Complex networks are all around us, and they can be generated by simple mechanisms. Understanding what kinds of networks can be produced by following simple rules is therefore of great importance. We investigate this issue by studying the dynamics of extremely simple systems where are `writer' moves around a network, and modifies it in a way that depends upon the writer's surroundings. Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it, which are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a way for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space of 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of behaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover simple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range of natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate visualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically. We arrive at an empirical classification scheme which reveals a lot about the kinds of dynamics and networks that can be generated by these systems.},

abstract = {This paper describes a flexible Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator designed to increase the limited displacement that these alloys can induce. The SMA actuator has been designed so that it can be bent up to about 180°, providing more freedom of movements and a better integration in wearable robots, specially in soft wearable robots, than standard rigid solutions. Although the actuator length is relatively short, this original design allows a great linear displacement, because it can have one or more loops of the same SMA wire inside the actuator. This implies that the length of the SMA wire is at least two times greater than the length of the actuator. The adopted strategy for both position and speed control that overcomes the hysteresis and prevents overheating the actuator is also described. The control algorithm has been implemented in a rapid control prototyping (RCP) system based on a low cost hardware platform. Finally, the application of this novel actuator in a wrist exoskeleton prototype is shown to demonstrate the feasibility of using the flexible SMA actuator in a real soft wearable robot.},

abstract = {Soft robots have become increasingly popular in recent years - and justifiably so. Their compliant structures and (theoretically) infinite degrees of freedom allow them to undertake tasks which would be impossible for their rigid body counterparts, such as conforming to uneven surfaces, efficiently distributing stress, and passing through small apertures. Previous work in the automated deign of soft robots has shown examples of these squishy creatures performing traditional robotic task like locomoting over flat ground. However, designing soft robots for traditional robotic tasks fails to fully utilize their unique advantages. In this work, we present the first example of a soft robot evolutionarily designed for reaching or squeezing through a small aperture - a task naturally suited to its type of morphology. We optimize these creatures with the CPPN-NEAT evolutionary algorithm, introducing a novel implementation of the algorithm which includes multi-objective optimization while retaining its speciation feature for diversity maintenance. We show that more compliant and deformable soft robots perform more effectively at this task than their less flexible counterparts. This work serves mainly as a proof of concept, but we hope that it helps to open the door for the better matching of tasks with appropriate morphologies in robotic design in the future. {\&}copy; 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},
